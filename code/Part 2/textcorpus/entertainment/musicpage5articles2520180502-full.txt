When a yellow sponge in rectangular pants came to childrens TV in 1999, who could have guessed that it would lead to SpongeBob SquarePants: The Broadway Musical, which was nominated this week for 12 Tony Awards?With the musical on a slate that includes Mean Girls and Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, it is almost as if one generations childhood has staged a friendly takeover.If youre not in that generation, or if youve been living under a rock, you may have missed the continued cultural relevance of SpongeBob. Were here to help.Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?SpongeBob SquarePants.Yes, and?Thats really it! Youre caught up. (Be sure to share this story on Facebook before closing the tab.)Michael, were paying you for this.Fine, fine.SpongeBob SquarePants, the sea creature at the heart of the animated television show that bears his name, is an absorbent, yellow and porous sponge.SpongeBob  Mr. SquarePants, if you prefer  is theoretically a sea sponge, but he presents as a yellow kitchen sponge who wears a shirt, tie and, as his surname suggests, rectangular brown pants.He is a rather cheerful, spirited fellow who works as a short-order cook. Hes nave and fairly pure of heart, generally assuming the best in everyone.He also happens to live in a pineapple in the undersea city of Bikini Bottom. The town is kind of an aquatic ecosystem unto itself, inhabited as it is by a colorful assortment of anthropomorphic marine animals that you wouldnt expect to see cohabitating in a tank at your local aquarium.Who else is there?Among the principal characters in SpongeBob SquarePants are a dimwitted starfish named Patrick who lives under a rock, a surly octopus named Squidward Tentacles who resides in a moai statue, a parsimonious crab who owns a fast-food restaurant, a teenage sperm whale who is somehow the crabs daughter, a Texan squirrel in scuba gear and a plankton bent on world domination who is married to an apparently waterproof supercomputer.Wow, thats Also, SpongeBob has a pet sea snail named Gary who meows like a house cat. Despite this, the shows other characters can generally understand him, and Gary often serves as the voice of reason.Hold on, what?Now seems like the time to mention that SpongeBob SquarePants describes itself as nautical nonsense in its opening theme song, which ought to give you a sense of the shows whimsical tone.As might be suggested by a cartoon about a humanoid kitchen tool, SpongeBob SquarePants is replete with visual gags and aquatic puns. For example: When SpongeBob and Patrick go jellyfishing, theyre catching jellyfish in butterfly nets and then milking them for their jelly. In another early episode, SpongeBob also plays hooky  which involves not only ditching work but also having fun with fishing hooks.Much of the shows humor also has cross-generational appeal. The show was designed for children, but its peppered with in-jokes that wink at teenagers and adults. Take SpongeBobs squirrel friend, who is named Sandy Cheeks. (In the spirit of SpongeBob, well let you work it out for yourself.)How did this become a big deal?Longevity, for starters. SpongeBob SquarePants made its debut in 1999 on Nickelodeon. It was created and developed by Stephen Hillenburg, an animator who had previously worked as a marine science educator.Nineteen years later, the show is still running. The cartoon is currently in its 11th season and has aired more than 230 episodes, making it Nickelodeons longest-running series.SpongeBob has also spawned video games, comic books and two movie adaptations. A third movie is due in 2020. When the musical was set to make its debut on Broadway in 2017, The New York Times reported that the SpongeBob franchise had been responsible for more than $13 billion in merchandise sales.The other thing that happened: SpongeBobs quirky underwater world saturated the internet just as it was rapidly expanding.What do you mean?More like what do you meme?(Fine, Ill leave the jokes to the SpongeBob writers.)Remember, SpongeBob really took off when many early online meme creators were children. As internet remix culture developed, so did they. At one point in the late 2000s, the show even aired on late-night MTV, surrounded by psychedelic, tie-dye bumpers.All the while, the show continued to gain fans among new classes of kindergartners who eventually grew up to ruin the internet.SpongeBob was so ubiquitous at the beginning of the 21st century that references to the show are widely understood. And with its high episode count, the show offers a lot of cultural references. Its easy meme fodder.So what are the memes?sO wHaT aRe The MeMeS?Well, thats just rude.Oh, sorry  thats one of them.The SpongeBob mocking meme takes a screenshot of a SpongeBob episode from 2012 (again, staying power) in which he is clucking like a chicken, paired with an alternating-case caption that is meant to imply a mocking tone.SpongeBob reaction shots are pretty popular. Theres also the Blurred Mr. Krabs meme, in which an internet user repurposes a shot of SpongeBobs crustacean boss, Mr. Krabs, looking confused and a little frightened as the world spins around him. Thats from a second-season episode that first aired in 2001; the meme took off in 2016.More recently, the internet meme-ified an image of Patrick Star, SpongeBobs bestie, looking particularly evil. It comes from an episode in the first season, in which SpongeBob gives up his modern urban life to live among the jellyfish. When Patrick, feeling ditched, tries to catch SpongeBob with a net, he makes a wicked face that internet users adopted.There are others that rely on some understanding of the show, like the meme that draws on the contrast between SpongeBobs place of employment, the Krusty Krab, and the inferior Chum Bucket, run by the villainous Plankton. Internet users replace the restaurant names with two things theyre comparing. Theyre counting on viewers to get that one is vastly superior.So this show is really popular, remixed a ton and is universally beloved?What are you, new here?Like most popular things, SpongeBob has drawn his fair share of detractors. But the criticism spreads beyond SpongeBob haters and has placed the show at the center of the culture wars.Whats the controversy?Well, for starters, in 2005, some religious conservatives accused SpongeBob of promoting a gay agenda.How?At the center of the issue was a music video that used childrens television characters to promote tolerance and diversity. SpongeBob appeared in it, alongside many other cartoon characters. According to The Times in 2005, nothing in the video referenced sexual identity. But at a black-tie dinner, Dr. James C. Dobson, the founder of Focus on the Family, singled out SpongeBob for promoting a pro-homosexual agenda, The Times wrote.Earlier, The Wall Street Journal had explained in 2002 that SpongeBob had become a popular camp figure among adult gay men. The story clarified that Nickelodeon says SpongeBob is aimed at kids two to 11 years old, and isnt intended to appeal to homosexuals and quoted Mr. Hillenburg saying SpongeBob and friends were not intended to be gay. He described them as somewhat asexual. Nevertheless, The Journal story spawned countless Is SpongeBob gay? blog posts, foreshadowing the future of internet journalism.How else is SpongeBob controversial?In 2011, Fox & Friends attacked Nickelodeon and SpongeBob for pushing a global warming agenda.And after SpongeBob was fired from his job at the Krusty Krab in 2013, liberals and conservatives fought over whether the show was making a statement about labor laws and social programs.And a study of 4-year-olds that was published in the journal Pediatrics in 2011 suggested that SpongeBobs frenetic energy was making children slower thinkers.Officials from Nickelodeon dismissed the findings, saying that preschool children were not the intended audience.So am I the shows audience?Thats for you to decide. Stream it!If youre looking for specific episodes, many fans agree that the shows prime was its first three seasons, before Mr. Hillenburg resigned as showrunner.Among the highlights of this period are Ripped Pants, a meditation on jokes that go too far; F.U.N., a celebration of friendship; Squidville, a Squidward-centric exploration of difference; and Prehibernation Week, which is particularly notable for its use of a song from the heavy metal band Pantera (its called Death Rattle).
