WASHINGTON  Before I get to Americas Mayor and Americas Nightmare, I would like to say this:Michelle Wolf was right when she turned a gimlet eye on the media.You guys are obsessed with Trump, the comedian said at the White House Correspondents Dinner. Did you used to date him? Because you pretend like you hate him, but I think you love him.I think what no one in this room wants to admit is that Trump has helped all of you. He couldnt sell steaks or vodka or water or college or ties or Eric, but he has helped you. Hes helped you sell your papers and your books and your TV. You helped create this monster, and now youre profiting off of him. If youre going to profit off of Trump, you should at least give him some money, because he doesnt have any.You know Donald Trump also believes that he is the best thing to ever happen to the media  and that he should be getting a cut of the action. Theres nothing he hates more than feeling that someone has profited off him, while he gets nothing. Remember when he proposed a $5 million ransom to show up at the CNN debate?Donald Trump is damaging the country and civic discourse, and undermining the First Amendment. But this Batman cartoon villain with an uncanny gift for cliffhangers and lurid story lines is buoying journalism, giving us a reprieve while we figure out how to save ourselves in the digital age.And hes making journalists stars in a way they havent been since Watergate, inspiring documentaries and movies and helping them secure lucrative book and TV deals.The most intense, toxic cat-and-mouse game in President Trumps life is not with Robert Mueller. Its with the press. (Besides, its not a cat-and-mouse game with Mueller; its just cat.)Trump is an attention addict, and now hes in a position to get all the attention in the world, as long as he keeps those sirens blaring. CNN has been on a constant Breaking News Alert for months. And we are Trump addicts, hooked on the hyperventilating rush of wild stories and all the great things that accrue from playing Beowulf to Trumps Grendel.As we pat ourselves on the back, though, for the grueling hours and Pulitzer-quality scoops, we should remember one thing: Even if we vanished tomorrow, Trump would probably end up in the same place.You could put a nanny cam on the guy and leave the room, and he would crash out of his high chair. He incriminates himself faster than we can incriminate him. And he surrounds himself, in the Trumpland of Misfit Toys, with playmates who have that same perverse gift for self-incrimination and immolation.You know youre in trouble when Donald Trump has to correct you on the facts. And Rudy Giuliani is in trouble. He and the Donald, the lawyer who was a mob buster and the president who acts like a mob boss, cooked up a harebrained plan to get Trump past the Stormy Daniels problem.The gruesome twosome, whose reputations have grown darker since the days when they swanned around New York as larger-than-life figuras, didnt consult any top White House officials, even the counsel. When Ashley Parker, a Washington Post White House reporter, texted a West Wing adviser, the adviser texted back a string of emojis, including a popcorn box, as in they were just watching this horror movie from the audience.Even on a great day, things are always unraveling with Trump. Chaos is always getting unleashed. Turbulence is always brewing.So Rudys scheme quickly unraveled.He admitted in TV interviews this week that President Trump had reimbursed Michael Cohen  also a Sean Hannity lawyer  for the $130,000 payoff to keep the porn star mum about her Lake Tahoe liaison with Trump, while claiming that the president didnt know specifically what the payment was for. Oh my goodness, I guess thats what it was for, Trump said, according to Giuliani, incredibly making the First Vulgarian sound more like Mike Pence or James Comey.Instead of getting Trump out of a jam, it jammed him into a deeper hole, giving Muellers team new areas of legal inquiry and material to add to its mountain of damaging records, and possibly helping the special counsel fill in the blanks on the 70 blank subpoena forms he just requested from a courthouse in Virginia.Trump distanced himself from his good friend, as he is wont to do, promising that Rudy will get his facts straight. This prompted Vanity Fair to write the headline: Trump Assures Reporters Hell Make Giuliani a Better Liar.Trumps game is keeping everyone, especially the press, riveted.He needs the excitement, says Trump biographer Michael DAntonio. Without the drama and the crisis and the powerful opponent, hed be just another guy.DAntonio compares Trump, who has compared himself to Babe Ruth and who once wrote a poem when he was 12 about being a baseball player  I like to hear the crowd give cheers, so loud and noisy to my ears  to Jimmy Piersall. Piersall, a charismatic and talented baseball player, described his emotional spiral in his memoir, The Truth Hurts: Probably the best thing that happened to me was going nuts. It brought people out to the ballpark to get a look at me.The center fielder engaged in brawls, scuffles and pranks, once bringing a water pistol to home plate. Then one day he lost his grip; in a movie based on his life, that was depicted as him climbing up the backstop at Fenway Park.That may wind up happening with Trump, DAntonio says. One day he might walk to Marine One stark naked and well all just say: This is the end. It has finally happened.
