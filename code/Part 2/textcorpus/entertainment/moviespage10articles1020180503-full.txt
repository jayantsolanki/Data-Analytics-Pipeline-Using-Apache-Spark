There are worse fates than finding out that your father is Bigfoot. They may include learning that youre the hero of a computer-animated film in which the humans look like bobbleheads.But The Son of Bigfoot, an English-language production from Belgium, more or less does what it sets out to do, which is to offer enough visual activity and bromides to keep the very young interested. To all others: There is no Bigfoot; theres nothing to see here.Having grown up thinking that his father is dead, Adam (voiced by Pappy Faulkner) starts to wonder why his hair grows so quickly and his feet have a habit of busting through his shoes. It turns out that, contrary to what his mother (Lindsay Torrance) has said, his father went into hiding because a nefarious hair-regrowth company wanted to turn him into a lab rat.But Adam runs away and finds his father (Chris Parson) about 100 miles from Portland, Ore. He learns about Bigfoots special powers, which include the abilities to heal with touch and to talk to animal friends, principally a bear, two raccoons, a woodpecker and a chipmunk. (Not to be purist, but are these skills part of the Bigfoot mystique, or merely representative of a desire to replicate past successful cartoons?)Of course, Adam leads the would-be baldness curers, who to all appearances have the resources of the F.B.I., straight to Bigfoot. Will the animals save the day? Does Bigfoot live in the woods?
