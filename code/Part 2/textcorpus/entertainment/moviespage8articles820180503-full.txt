The Desert Bride, an Argentine-Chilean feature from the directors Cecilia Atn and Valeria Pivato, tells a slight story so gingerly that the film almost seems to recede into the horizon as you watch it. A road movie of sorts, it steers clear of melodrama or sentimentality, but it also never risks hitting anything.To be fair, such restraint may be intended as a reflection of the protagonist, Teresa (the Chilean actress Paulina Garca, who earned raves a few years ago for the film Gloria), who has spent more than half her life working unassumingly as a maid in Buenos Aires. As The Desert Bride opens, she is shown walking with a group along a desert road, after a bird has damaged the windshield of their bus. Flashbacks reveal that she is on a 600-mile journey to a new employer  part of the same family shes always worked for, but unknown to her.The search for a missing bag brings her together with a merchant called Gringo (Claudio Rissi), and the prospect that a magical romance will bloom is never far away. The religious and mystical associations of this Western Argentine region are noted periodically, perhaps to a greater extent than the payoff requires.Ms. Atn and Ms. Pivato frequently film their stars at a slight distance, as if afraid to get too close. But the effect is to make them background elements in their own story. Postcard-perfect landscapes will only get you so far.
