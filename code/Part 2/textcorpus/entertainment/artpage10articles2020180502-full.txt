To the Editor:Re The Soul-Crushing Student Essay, by Scott Korb (On Campus column, Sunday Review, April 22):Students should know that writing, like art, expresses how we feel, what we know, our dreams and our opinions, crafted using the written word, as an artist dips into a palette.Heres some advice: Strip away constraints, banish the passive voice, write for joy, for catharsis. Take chances. Read out loud. Learn how to edit. Read one anothers essays. Critique. Discuss. Read as if dining on a multicourse meal, savoring each bite. If it doesnt suit your tastes, read it again, slowly.Everyone has a beautiful writer inside. You just need to coax it out, one word at a time.JEFFREY H. TONEY, UNION, N.J.The writer is provost and vice president for academic affairs at Kean University.To the Editor:Scott Korbs article has already elicited comments from former students of mine at several high schools, recognizing in his essay what they had heard from me and from a former colleague.That colleague and I sat with our students writing, evaluating one essay at a time from our own class and then one from the colleagues class. We gradually came to some conclusions about writing and our young writers:It should always be in the first person. It should be about a subject the student knows, cares deeply about and wants to think further about.These students have already experienced many of the important parts of life. If they write from these conclusions, they can teach themselves to write well.Weve seen it happen.BRIAN W. FORD, CONCORD, MASS.
