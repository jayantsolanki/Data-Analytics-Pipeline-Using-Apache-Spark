The new trailer for Ant-Man and the Wasp is set to the tune of Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rocks hip-hop classic It Takes Two, and the titular superheroes played by Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly do seem to make a dynamic duo.In this sequel to the 2015 hit Ant-Man, the escaped convict Scott Lang and the scientists daughter Hope Van Dyne reassume their insect identities and team up with Scotts former cellmate (Michael Pea) to battle a ghostlike villain who has stolen the technology that allows them to shrink or grow exponentially.Striking a lighter tone than Marvels current blockbuster Avengers: Infinity War, the comic adventure sees its crimefighters utilizing unlikely weapons like a giant saltshaker to stop their foes. One of them is played by Walton Goggins, who was also cast as a bad guy in this years Tomb Raider and appears briefly in the trailer.Theres no sign of Michelle Pfeiffer as Hopes mom, Janet Van Dyne, a.k.a. the Original Wasp, but since her husband Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) opens up the Quantum Realm where shes been trapped, it seems certain shell appear in the film.You go low, I go high, Ant-Man suggests to the Wasp, who logically replies, I have wings  why would I go low? Marvel Studios hopes to reach box-office heights when Ant-Man and the Wasp lands in theaters on July 6.
