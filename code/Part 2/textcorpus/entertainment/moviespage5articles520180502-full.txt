A young would-be photographer whos supplementing his income via petty thievery breaks into the wrong house early in Bad Samaritan. One half of a team operating a valet-parking scam in Portland, Oregon, Sean (Robert Sheehan) thinks hes struck gold after gaining entry to the home of the ultra-haughty Maserati-driving Cale Erendreich (David Tennant). Instead he finds what appears to be the lair of a serial killer  think a moneyed version of Buffalo Bill in Silence of the Lambs. He also finds one of Cales victims chained to a chair, and still alive.A failure of moral nerve compels Sean to leave the scene, but guess what, he feels kind of bad about it. The intrusion drives Cale to go into supervillain mode, methodically destroying Seans life while continuing to toy with the woman hes kidnapped.The story line, not to mention the trappings of wealth, make the movie feel a bit like a tribute to the cheesy deluxe-house-of-guilty-mirrors thrillers of the 80s and 90s  Jagged Edge, Fatal Attraction and so on. The Bad Samaritan director, Dean Devlin, handles the proceedings like Adrian Lyne (who directed Fatal Attraction) on HGH supplements (and divested of over a third of Mr. Lynes visual elegance, such as it is).Mr. Tennant, who usually is scrupulous in conveying the nuances of volatile characters (see his work on the British television series Broadchurch), just goes utterly bananas here. Particularly in the last 15 minutes when, for reasons perhaps only fully known to himself, he attempts an impersonation of Steve Carells character on The Office.
