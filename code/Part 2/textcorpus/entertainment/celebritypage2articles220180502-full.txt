Dear Diary:Barb and I were at a table in a nook in the back of a restaurant on the Upper East Side, away from the crowd. A few minutes after we were seated, a family came in: parents with two adult children who appeared to be in their 20s. They sat down at the other table in the nook.I caught a glimpse of the fathers profile, and knew right away who it was: Bill Murray.A moment later I felt Barb kicking me under the table.Do you know who that is? she whispered.Yes, I whispered back.The family had obviously asked to be seated in the nook so they would not be disturbed. The way we were seated, I had a good view of the children, while Barb had a view of the parents.After the waitress took our order, I tried to look at the father again. From the little I could see, I decided it wasnt Bill Murray after all.Its not him, I whispered to Barb.It is, she insisted. And thats his wife.I wouldnt have recognized Bill Murrays wife in a million years. Besides, all I could see was her profile. The light in the nook was adequate, but not great. After sneaking another partial glimpse, I was still pretty certain it wasnt Bill Murray. And overhearing a brief snippet of their conversation, I decided it didnt sound like him, either.Its not him, I whispered again.It is, Barb insisted.We continued the debate through the rest meal. When we finished, I paid the check, and we got up to leave. I was finally able to get a good look at the couple. I should have known better than to doubt Barbs celebrity-sighting ability.It was Kevin Kline and Phoebe Cates.
