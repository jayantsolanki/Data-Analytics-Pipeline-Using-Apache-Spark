Recently, Pat Hackett, a New York-based writer and editor, opened an unassuming three-ring binder in her Gramercy Park apartment and discovered 83 unpublished photographs by Andy Warhol. The images  which depict, among other subjects, Brooke Shields, Muhammad Ali, Farrah Fawcett, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Warhols two pet dachshunds, Archie and Amos, seated with Lou Reed  had been gifted to Hackett by Warhol not long before his death, in 1987, and had not left her home since.Hackett was one of Warhols frequent collaborators and confidantes; she contributed to Interview, co-wrote his final film, BAD (1977), and later edited his posthumously published Diaries (1989). While working on another project, Warhols arch entertaining manual The Party Book (1988), she took home a selection of the artists photographs  casual portraits of friends and vivid snapshots of New York nightlife  to review as possible illustrations. A few days later, when I mentioned that I would bring them back soon, he said, Oh you dont have to. Hed noticed how much I loved them, recalls Hackett.The previously unpublished and unexhibited images, which will go on show for the first time on May 3 at Hedges Projects in Los Angeles, are all one-of-a-kind silver gelatin prints that capture their subjects in stark black and white. Oddly, as much as Andy is known as the master colorist, there is a whole powerful, primitive area of his work that was exclusively black and white, says Hackett.Warhol turned to photography more and more in the years before his death, and you could see how much it excited him, she adds. His whole view of the world and of art had always been that reality could not be improved upon. That made photography a natural next big step in his evolution as an artist.
