The new Brooklyn home of the Center for Fiction will open in January 2019, the nonprofit organization announced Friday.Construction on its 17,500-square-foot space in Downtown Brooklyn began in late April. When it is complete, the three-story facility at 15 Lafayette Avenue will include a bookstore, a cafe, a library, classrooms and a 160-seat auditorium.Brooklyn is home to so many wonderful writers and devoted readers and we are very much looking forward to serving them and all New Yorkers in this beautiful new building, Noreen Tomassi, the centers executive director, said in a statement.The Center for Fiction describes itself as the only organization in the U.S. solely devoted to the creation and enjoyment of the art of fiction.It was established as the Mercantile Library, a lending library for merchant clerks, in 1820 in Lower Manhattan, and occupied several other locations before landing in Midtown in 1932. In 2008, the organization renamed itself the Center for Fiction, and later sold its Midtown building, on East 47th Street.The Center for Fiction will jointly own the new building along with the Mark Morris Dance Group and the real estate development company BCD, each of which will build its own separate space there. Julie Nelson at BKSK Architects has designed the interior of the Center for Fiction.
