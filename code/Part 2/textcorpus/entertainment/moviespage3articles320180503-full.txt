Ren writes: Our children, ages 7 and 9, love James Bond movies. Weve seen almost every one, but my wife doesnt want them to see Casino Royale. Its often referred to as the best Bond, but she believes it is too inappropriate for them. Can you help? Id like to watch the movie with my kids, who are James Bond fans just like me.Of course 7- and 9-year-olds like movies with cars that fly. But they dont love problematic gender portrayals and seventh-grade-level sex jokes. Thats why Ian Fleming wrote Chitty Chitty Bang Bang for children and the James Bond series for man-children. But if Casino Royale (which is great!) is truly the last one you have left, why not? Why not complete your experiment and cuddle up with your kids and watch Daniel Craig be tortured in a very private area? No one can stop your mad plan now. Not even you, Mr. Bond!
