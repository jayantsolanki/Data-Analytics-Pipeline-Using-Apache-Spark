At a time when increasing attention is being paid to female artists, the David Zwirner gallery has taken on representation of the abstract painter Joan Mitchell, who died in 1992.In a telephone interview, Mr. Zwirner called Mitchell one of the great American artists of the second half of the 20th century.Shes such an interesting, complex artist  a woman in a mans world coming into her own in the 50s, he said. A new appreciation of her work is happening as we speak.The gallery is planning a solo exhibition of Mitchells work for 2019 in New York.Christa Blatchford, the chief executive officer of the Joan Mitchell Foundation  previously represented by Cheim & Read  said it was time to re-evaluate and Zwirner seemed like the right fit.We admired the level of scholarship, the quality of the artists and the international scope, Ms. Blatchford said.
