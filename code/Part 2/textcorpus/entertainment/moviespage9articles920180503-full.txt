Taking a dig at self-help movements and dietary gurus (especially the notorious master cleanse program), The Cleanse embarks on an allegorical journey with only the vaguest notion of a destination. As a result, the movie feels frustratingly repetitive  a single joke repeated ad nauseam.The nausea is real, as Paul Berger (Johnny Galecki) is about to find out. Unloved and unemployed, and looking to reboot his sorry life, Paul signs up for a program that promises to purify both mind and body. Transported to an isolated cabin compound in the mountains, he and three other hopefuls are welcomed with a disgusting-looking beverage. As the sole long-term resident of the retreat looks like death warmed over, drinking it doesnt seem like the smartest move.Sure enough, violent vomiting and other evacuations ensue, underscored by the movies often queasy-green palette. But amid the displaced gunk are fast-growing creatures that look repulsive yet are strangely endearing, like the worlds ugliest babies. The psychological-baggage metaphor is obvious; yet as the guests struggle to detach from their creatures, the writer and director, Bobby Miller, runs out of ideas. Seesawing between humor and pathos, he fails to develop the storys occasional hints of underlying nastiness that suggest the program is not entirely benign.He also leaves Oliver Platt and Anjelica Huston, as the retreat leaders, bafflingly in the background. Mr. Galecki is a master of sad-sack ineptitude, but Paul is such a vague character that if he committed a murder in front of you, youd be hard pressed to identify him. The movie, on the other hand, is much easier to label: its just bizarre.
