Everything Else (Todo lo dems), the first narrative feature from the documentary filmmaker Natalia Almada, is a low-key character study whose gently repetitive rhythms mask an unusually keen sense of nuance and subtlety.With laserlike focus, the movie observes the monotonous daily rituals of Doa Flor (Adriana Barraza), a 63-year-old government clerk in Mexico City. For more than three decades, in the same nondescript department, she has processed applications for voter-identification cards. With metronomic efficiency, she checks documents and unspools red tape before returning to her drab apartment and beloved cat  her sole companion.Aside from Doas daily subway rides and occasional, unnerving glimpses of the city at night, Everything Else unfolds in a closed loop of office, apartment and a public pool where Doa silently watches children swim. The films discipline and quotidian dreariness can be wearying. Yet between Ms. Barrazas impressive performance and Lorenzo Hagermans beautifully textured photography (he also shot Rick Alversons Entertainment, another hyper-focused study of psychological pain), the storys tragedy gradually accumulates.A portrait of extreme isolation, Everything Else is also a movie about women, their bodies crammed together in subway cars and reported, missing or abused, on the evening news. Their comradeship at the pool is a solace that Doa Flor seeks even when she cant enter the water; and with each cycle of her routines, her actions become merely the bass line of a slow song of awakening. Her barriers are being shaken, not by cataclysm, but by the steady drip of a loneliness that she can no longer abide.
