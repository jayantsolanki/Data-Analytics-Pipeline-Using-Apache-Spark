The sensations that Strangers on the Earth means to evoke are not well suited to the cinematic medium, at least not to a documentary that barely runs more than an hour and a half. To get into the proper contemplative frame of mind, you would need to spend a month walking the Camino de Santiago across Spain, the same journey  a famous Catholic pilgrimage  that its principal subject takes.Dane Johansen, an American cellist, sets out to hike a route that extends from the Pyrenees in the east to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, regarded as the final resting place of St. James, in the west, playing Bachs suites in 36 ancient churches along the way. The director, Tristan Cook, mingles Mr. Johansens reflections with footage of and voice-overs from other travelers (there is semantic parsing over who warrants the designation pilgrim), giving some sense of the profundity of the experience.We hear about what it feels like to leave everything behind, about impromptu friendships, about how strange urban life seems when the trail leads into a city and even about the dissatisfaction that can ensue at the end.Still, Strangers on the Earth raises questions about how it was made, and even whether making it defeats the inherent asceticism of the project. Presumably having a camera on you at least part of the time is disruptive to the mood. (Are the filmmakers hiking as well?) And Strangers could have spent more time with Mr. Johansens music instead of hurrying to each successive destination.
