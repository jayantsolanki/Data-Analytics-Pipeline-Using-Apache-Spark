But of course, like any birthday, it was hard to totally avoid.Our bosses in New York sent us pastries with a nice note. Our New York Times communications team tweeted out a congratulations message. A Crikey columnist examined the response to our efforts.And, with a bit of lucky timing, this weeks Australia Diary ended up being about birthday cakes. Not just any birthday cakes, but the crazy brilliant sensations that children of the 1980s and 90s enjoyed, thanks to ambitious relatives and recipes from The Australian Womens Weekly Childrens Birthday Cake Cookbook.Molly OBrien, an Australian reader of The New York Times in Brooklyn, did a fantastic job explaining her own history with the elaborate confections. (She was partial to the Swimming Pool cake, in case you were wondering.)She also put it all into context, noting that the books creations fulfilled countless sugary dreams for Australian kids and undoubtedly contributed to kitchen meltdowns nationwide.We loved her story and photos so much that we decided to ask all of you for your own experiences with Womens Weekly cakes, or anything that might compete with them.Share your photos and memories and well post what we collect. (The image above is one shining example of what weve been receiving.)But her submission also reminded me of how much can be learned when journalism becomes more communal and conversational. I would never have known about cakes like the Maypole or Rocking Horse  nor would I have known they were such cultural touchstones  if not for our attempt to throw open the doors, and invite in readers stories. Your stories.Looking back over the past year, there are so many things I wouldnt have known if not for readers of this newsletter.The responses to last weeks Australia Letter about history taught me just how common it was to grow up in Australia years ago without being taught Indigenous history  something I hadnt realized since my own children are receiving more of that education in their public school.If not for all of you, I also wouldnt have grasped the depth of appreciation for Nippers, nor the nuance and divisions that shape discussions of race and multiculturalism, or gender and power.I would have missed out on many great books, restaurants, music and movies that many of you suggested; I would have misunderstood the rivalry among Australias capital cities, or the degree to which people care so much about those that are often overlooked  Im looking at you Darwin, Adelaide and Perth  if not for those who wrote to tell us what they loved about where they lived, and why.I could go on but the point is, for our first anniversary, Im not going to boast about all the journalism we did that Im proud of, though theres a fair amount of that.Im just going to thank you for making the journalism better.Foreign correspondence is nothing if not an attempt to understand, and our bureaus understanding of Australia  even for those who are Australian  has occurred at an accelerated pace thanks to you.So happy birthday to all of us engaged in this project. Lets make year two even better.And send us your cakes pictures!Anything made with ambition and love must have something to teach, right?Here are our stories of the week, starting with Australia, followed by recommendations for what to watch this month.______Cardinal Pell Will Stand Trial The news of the week, for Australia and Catholics everywhere: A Victoria court ruled that Cardinal George Pell, the Vaticans No. 3 official, will go to trial on charges of historical sex offenses.The most serious charges were dismissed, but there are several significant charges going forward, from multiple complainants.If youre wondering why the case has been so secretive, heres a guide on whats happening (and why the court has revealed so little information).One of our reporters, Jacqueline Williams, also went to Ballarat, Cardinal Pells hometown, where she explored how the old mining town is learning to talk about decades of sexual abuse of children by Catholic priests.______More From AustraliaCulture Polixeni Papapetrou, Photographer With an Eerie Eye, Dies at 57: Her photographs often featured her own children in startling costumes, but the most attention-getting one involved no clothes at all.
