A synergistic expression of the corporate interests of Marvel Studios and the Walt Disney Company.Youll like it if you liked: Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor, Black Panther, or anything in Marvels cinematic universe.Critics take: Above all, the Disney-Marvel combination is a giant machine that manufactures maximum consent. The cosmos is theirs. The rest of us just live in it.Read the full review by A.O. Scott.Australian release date: April 25Further reading: A.O Scotts spoiler-filled article about the ending of Avengers: Infinity War.I Feel PrettyStarring: Amy Schumer, Michelle Williams, Emily Ratajkowski, Busy Philipps, Tom HopperDirected by: Abby Kohn, Marc SilversteinWhat is it? A lovable, not-quite-loser suffers a knockout blow and wakes up believing she is a knockout.Youll like it if you liked: Trainwreck or Snatched.Critics take: The idea that a lack of self-confidence can be essentially bootstrapped away  that all we need to combat oppressive forces is the power of positive thinking and a flattering lipstick  is an exhausted, false fairy tale, one peddled by (among others!) self-help books, beauty companies and, disappointingly, movies like this one.Read the full review by Manohla Dargis.Australian release date: April 19Further reading: Amanda Hesss take on I Feel Pretty and why expectations for female beauty have never been higher  its just taboo to admit it.LovelessStarring: Maryana Spivak, Aleksey Rozin, Varvara Shmykova, Matvey Novikov, Daria PisarevaDirected by: Andrey ZvyagintsevWhat is it? A boy in Moscow listens to his parents argue over who will be saddled with the child that neither wants. Then he disappears.Youll like it if you liked: Leviathan, by the same director.Critics take:  Its a grimly cynical view of modern Russia thats inarguably blunt (especially in an extended shot of Zhenya, running on a treadmill to nowhere, the word Russia emblazoned on her sweatsuit) but no less chilling for that.Read the full review by Jeannette Catsoulis.Australian release date: April 25UnsaneStarring: Claire Foy, Joshua Leonard, Jay Pharoah, Juno Temple, Sarah StilesDirected by: Steven SoderberghWhat is it? A stalking victim ends up involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital  with the stalker possibly in the building.Youll like it if you liked: The Shining  at least if you enjoy a wide-angle sojourn through a creepy, constrictive hallway.Critics take: Mr. Soderbergh shot Unsane primarily on iPhones using additional lenses, including a fish-eye  Big budget or on the cheap, like here, he is a great shooter and he plays with perspective inventively, distorting the edges of the image so they bulge out, a warping that dovetails with Sawyers disturbed, disturbing world.Read the full review by Manohla Dargis.Australian release date: April 25ChappaquiddickStarring: Kate Mara, Clancy Brown, Olivia Thirlby, Jason Clarke, Ed HelmsDirected by: John CurranWhat is it? In the summer of 1969, a car driven by Senator Edward M. Kennedy runs off a bridge and into a pond, killing a passenger.Youll like it if you: Would enjoy a refreshingly sober take on the Kennedys, without airy evocations of idealism and tragedy.Critics take: The test that Chappaquiddick sets for itself is not accuracy but plausibility. Whether or not events actually unfolded this way, the story the film tells is an interesting and complicated character study, with something to say about the corrosive effects of power and privilege on both the innocent and the guilty.Read the full review by A.O. Scott.Australian release date: May 10Crooked HouseStarring: Christina Hendricks, Gillian Anderson, Honor Kneafsey, Glenn Close, Max IronsDirected by: Gilles Paquet-BrennerWhat is it? A much-loathed patriarch is sent to his grave, and a houseful of resentful, back-stabbing kinfolk are under suspicion.Youll like it if you liked: Murder on the Orient Express or Gosford Park.Critics take: At its best, as when Ms. Hendricks swans around her cavernous bedroom bopping to early rock n roll records, the movie feels like a version of Gosford Park taken over by Franois Ozon. But Crooked House is not so often this giddy. The superb cast provides mild pleasures, as do some aspects of the elaborate mystery itself. And thats all, folks.Read the full review by Glenn Kenny. Australian release date: May 10
