What there is is Negotiations going on with North Korea over Nuclear War, Negotiations going on with China over Trade Deficits, Negotiations on NAFTA, and much more. Witch Hunt! [0745 EDT]- "The questions are an intrusion into the President\'s Article 2 powers under the Constitution to fire any Executive Branch Employee...what the President was thinking is an outrageous.....as to the Presiden\'s unfettered power to fire anyone..." Joe Digenova, former US Attorney [0923 EDT]- NEW BOOK - A MUST READ! "The Russia Hoax - The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump" by the brilliant Fox News Legal Analyst Gregg Jarrett. A sad chapter for law enforcement. A rigged system! [0933 EDT]- A Rigged System - They don\'t want to turn over Documents to Congress. What are they afraid of? Why so much redacting? Why such unequal "justice?" At some point I will have no choice but to use the powers granted to the Presidency and get involved! [1045 EDT]- Congratulations @SecPompeo! [1416 EDT]- I have been briefed on the U.S. C-130 Hercules cargo plane from the Puerto Rico National Guard that crashed near Savannah Hilton Head International Airport. Please join me in thoughts and prayers for the victims, their families and the great men and women of the National Guard. [1627 EDT]- "This isn\'t some game. You are screwing with the work of the president of the United States." John Dowd, March 2018. With North Korea, China, the Middle East and so much more, there is not much time to be thinking about this, especially since there was no Russian "Collusion."
