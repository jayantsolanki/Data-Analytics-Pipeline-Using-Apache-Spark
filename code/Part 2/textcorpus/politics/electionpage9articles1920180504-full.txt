WASHINGTON  President Donald Trump\'s attorney Rudy Giuliani said on Friday a $130,000 payment another Trump lawyer made to silence adult-film star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election did not violate campaign laws, saying it would have been made even if Trump were not running."The payment was made to resolve a personal and false allegation in order to protect the presidents family," Giuliani said in a statement. "It would have been done in any event, whether he was a candidate or not." (Reporting by Timothy Ahmann; Editing by David Alexander)
