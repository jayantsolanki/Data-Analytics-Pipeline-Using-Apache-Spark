ROME  Far-right League leader Matteo Salvini said on Friday any stopgap government to take Italy to new elections must be led by a center-right politician who rejects current European Union budget rules.President Sergio Mattarella will meet party leaders on Monday to try to secure a coalition deal following an inconclusive March 4 election, but failing that, is expected to seek backing for a technocrat government to help keep Italy\'s finances on track.Salvini told reporters the League would back a short-term government with a six-month lifespan if the cabinet were made up of politicians, not technocrats and if it agrees to "completely re-write" Italy\'s relations with the European Union.He said the center-left Democratic Party must be no part of the government and he wanted it to include the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement. 5-Star has this week demanded a re-vote in June and ruled out any stopgap government.
