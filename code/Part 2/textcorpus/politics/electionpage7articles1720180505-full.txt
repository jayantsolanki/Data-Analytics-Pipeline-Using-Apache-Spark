BERLIN  Lawmakers from Catalonia's leading separatist party say they will try to re-elect fugitive former leader Carles Puigdemont as the president of the region despite the expected prohibition by Spanish courts.Puigdemont met Saturday with members of his Together for Catalonia coalition in Berlin, where he is awaiting extradition to Spain on charges of rebellion and misuse of public funds in organizing an unauthorized referendum last year on Catalonia's independence.Coalition spokesman Eduard Pujol says they will try to elect Puigdemont by May 14.If a president is not sworn in by May 22 a new election will be triggered.Separatist lawmakers changed regional laws Friday to allow Catalonia's president to be sworn in without being present.Spanish courts have blocked past efforts by Catalan separatists to continue their secession push.
