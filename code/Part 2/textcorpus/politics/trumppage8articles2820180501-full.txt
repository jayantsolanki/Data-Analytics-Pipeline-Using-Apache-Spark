This was a total disaster and an embarrassment to our great Country and all that it stands for. FAKE NEWS is alive and well and beautifully represented on Saturday night![0810 EDT]- Numerous countries are being considered for the MEETING, but would Peace House/Freedom House, on the Border of North & South Korea, be a more Representative, Important and Lasting site than a third party country? Just asking! [0819 EDT] - I recently had a terrific meeting with a bipartisan group of freshman lawmakers who feel very strongly in favor of Congressional term limits. I gave them my full support and endorsement for their efforts. #DrainTheSwamp [1454 EDT]- The migrant \'caravan\' that is openly defying our border shows how weak & ineffective U.S. immigration laws are. Yet Democrats like Jon Tester continue to support the open borders agenda  Tester even voted to protect Sanctuary Cities. We need lawmakers who will put America First. [1838 EDT]- During Small Business Week, we celebrate the great, hard-working entrepreneurs across our country who have started and operate a small business! [1839 EDT]- The Fake News is going crazy making up false stories and using only unnamed sources (who don\'t exist). They are totally unhinged, and the great success of this Administration is making them do and say things that even they cant believe they are saying. Truly bad people! [1849 EDT]- The White House is running very smoothly despite phony Witch Hunts etc. There is great Energy and unending Stamina, both necessary to get things done. We are accomplishing the unthinkable and setting positive records while doing so! Fake News is going "bonkers!"
