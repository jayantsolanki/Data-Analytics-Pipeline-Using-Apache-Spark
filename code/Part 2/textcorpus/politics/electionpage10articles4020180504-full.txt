To the Editor:Re Mr. Abbass Vile Words (editorial, May 3):As a member of the Senate and the special representative for combating anti-Semitism, racism and intolerance for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europes Parliamentary Assembly, I am appalled by comments by Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority, ascribing to the Nazis financial, rather than racial or religious, motives for murdering six million Jews in the Holocaust.Such rhetoric has no place in civilized society, and Mr. Abbass comments stand as a particularly troubling example of political anti-Semitism. I would like to believe that Mr. Abbas knows better. He took three days to apologize, but the damage has been done, driving yet another wedge between the Israelis and the Palestinians.It is now incumbent upon Mr. Abbas, after his re-election, to make strong overtures to the Israelis to show that he is a credible partner for two-state-solution negotiations, essential to the futures of Israelis and Palestinians alike.If he cannot, then he must vacate his leadership position immediately for someone who does not embrace and espouse the most anti-Semitic of tales and innuendos.BEN CARDIN, WASHINGTONThe writer, a Maryland Democrat, is a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
