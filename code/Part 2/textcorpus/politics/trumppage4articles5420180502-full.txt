If Trumps aides and appointees go along with his various power grabs, Trump may well succeed. If other officials refuse, he is likely to fail.All of which makes Rod Rosensteins comments yesterday noteworthy. Rosenstein, of course, is the deputy attorney general, overseeing Robert Muellers investigation into Trump. In an appearance at the Newseum in Washington, Rosenstein said that people have for quite some time been threatening him privately and publicly. I think they should understand by now the Department of Justice is not going to be extorted, he added. Were going to do whats required by the rule of law.Who exactly has been threatening him? The president of the United States who appointed him, as well as members of the presidents party in Congress.Put in a terribly uncomfortable position, Rosenstein showed how to stand up for the rule of law. In doing so, he is keeping faith with a tradition of Justice Department independence that spans both Democratic and Republican administrations over the past half-century  but that Trump is trying to break.Rosensteins example is particularly important, because he hasnt always been willing to stand up to his boss. But he now seems to have found his courage. If only more members of Congress and Republican elders would do the same.Iran deal. In Israel this week, we saw another cost to Trumps disinterest in facts.Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, gave a televised presentation bashing the Iran nuclear deal, but he offered no evidence that Iran has violated its terms. Netanyahu instead talked about Irans efforts to disguise its nuclear program before it agreed to a deal in 2015 with the United States, China and European countries. Surely, Netanyahu  who has opposed the deal since the beginning  would have offered evidence of cheating if that evidence existed.But evidence wasnt the point of the presentation, as The Atlantics Peter Beinart writes. The point was goading Trump into canceling the deal. Netanyahu understood his audience: A president bored by policy details, surrounded by advisors like John Bolton, who have long argued for abandoning the deal. It was, Beinart concludes, the first example of a foreign leader using television to sway Trump in the way American politicians and pundits do.Trump is likely to announce a decision on the deal before the end of summer.In The Times, my colleague Bret Stephens offers a different take, writing that Irans history of dishonesty and noncompliance means that the United States should not keep the current deal. The Times editorial board criticizes Netanyahus flimflam. And Antony Blinken, President Barack Obamas former deputy secretary of state, argues that scrapping the Iran deal would damage the chances of a nuclear deal with North Korea.Reader ideas. The Letters page features responses to my recent column calling for bold economic ideas. Among them: Elizabeth Bjorkmans calls for two years of mandatory national service for all citizens ages 18 to 28.
