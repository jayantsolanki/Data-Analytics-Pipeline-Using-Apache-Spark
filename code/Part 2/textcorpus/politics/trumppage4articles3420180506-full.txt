DUBAI  President Hassan Rouhani on Sunday rejected threats by U.S. President Donald Trump to withdraw from Iran\'s nuclear deal with world powers, saying Iranians would not be affected because of their experience of a long war with Iraq. "You (U.S.) should know that you cannot threaten this great nation because our people withstood eight year of ... defence (in the war with Iraq)," Rouhani said in a speech carried live on state television.
