AUSTIN, Texas  Ex-Congressman Blake Farenthold has rejected Texas Gov. Greg Abbott\'s request that he pay for a special election to fill his old seat.The Houston Chronicle says Farenthold wrote to Abbott, "Since I didn\'t call it and I don\'t think it\'s necessary, I shouldn\'t be asked to pay for it."Farenthold resigned April 6 amid sexual harassment allegations.He\'s promised to reimburse $84,000 from a House fund used to settle a 2014 sexual harassment claim, but hasn\'t done so.Abbott called an emergency special election for June 30 to finish Farenthold\'s term through Jan. 3. He says it\'s vital since Hurricane Harvey ravaged the district.Abbott last week asked Farenthold to use the $84,000 on the special election, though that probably won\'t fully cover it. But Abbott can\'t make Farenthold comply.___Information from: Houston Chronicle, http://www.houstonchronicle.com
