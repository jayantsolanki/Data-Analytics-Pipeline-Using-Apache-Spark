WASHINGTON  Nikki Haley says President Donald Trump has "his communication style," but the U.N. ambassador says "you\'re not hearing me defend that."She tells CBS\' "Sunday Morning" that "if there is anything that he communicates in a way that I\'m uncomfortable with, I pick up the phone and call him."The former South Carolina governor says she doesn\'t need to go public about "a private conversation that should happen when I feel it. ... and I think it\'s one that he\'s receptive to when I do."Haley also says Trump shouldn\'t try to shut down special counsel Robert Mueller\'s Russia investigation. She says "it should go through the process. But they need to do it quickly. For the good of the country, this investigation needs to happen quickly."
