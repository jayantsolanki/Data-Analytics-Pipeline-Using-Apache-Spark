We in the commentariat complain about President Trump, but were locked in a symbiotic relationship with him.News organizations, especially cable television channels, feed off Trump  like oxpeckers on a rhinos back  for he is part of our business model in 2018. As long as our focus is on Trump, audiences follow.Its not optimal to have as president an authoritarian who denounces journalists as enemies of the people, but he has given us a sense of mission and a Trump bump. Every time he denounces us we get more subscriptions.(If youre reading this, President Trump, Id appreciate a good, thunderous excoriation. Youve gone after Maggie Haberman, Don Lemon and Chuck Todd, but youve publicly denounced me only once  and so incoherently that I couldnt print out a quote to impress my kids. Next time youre on Twitter, how about firing off something concise like: Crackpot Krisitofff is the WORST lying reporter at the FAILING NYTimes EVER!!!)Yet I worry that our national nonstop focus on Trump is helping to usher America into a hole: a Trump obsession. The danger is that Trump sucks up all the oxygen, so that other issues dont get adequate attention.[While I have you here, I wanted to remind you that you can sign up for my twice-weekly newsletter here.]In America today, its all Trump, all the time. Were collectively addicted to him. The nonstop scandals and outrages suck us in; they amount to Trump porn.As president, Trump is enormously important, but theres so much else happening as well. Some 65,000 Americans will die this year of drug overdoses, American life expectancy has fallen for two years in a row, guns claim a life every 15 minutes and the number of uninsured is rising again even as a child in the U.S. is 70 percent more likely to die before adulthood than one in other advanced nations. Those issues are rather more important than the question of whether Stormy Daniels slept with Trump.Or look abroad. In Myanmar, the government is engaging in what many believe to be a genocide against the Rohingya minority. Gaza is erupting, and theres heightened threat of a new war in the Middle East. The U.S. has been complicit in Saudi Arabian war crimes in Yemen. The carnage in Syria continues.The worlds progress against malaria, which kills almost one person a minute, has stalled. A fifth of children under 5 worldwide are stunted from malnutrition. Bill Gates and others warn that one of our top risks is a pandemic for which we are ill prepared.Progressive snobs like me bemoan Trumps inattention to these global issues, but the truth is that we dont pay attention, either. At cocktail parties, on cable television, at the dinner table, at the water cooler, all we talk about these days is Trump. So we complain about Trump being insular and parochial  but weve become insular and parochial as well. Weve caught the contagion that we mock.Im addicted myself, which is why I write so much about Trump  or catch myself on a date night with my wife engaging in horrified conversation about Trump.In fairness, theres good reason were all Trump addicts: President Trump truly is THE story in America today. He is systematically undermining American institutions and norms that underlie democratic government: courts, law enforcement, journalism, the intelligence community, truth. He is also being investigated for possibly obstructing justice and colluding with a foreign powers attack on our electoral system. Epic battles will follow.Two thousand years from now, historians may be lecturing on Trump the way they now discuss, say, the challenge to Roman institutions from Caligula.So Im not arguing that we avert our eyes from Trump or mute our criticism. Far from it. But we have to figure out how to spare bandwidth for genocide in Myanmar, opioids in America and so on.It would also be useful if we recognized that the biggest Trump scandals are not what he says, but what he does.His tweets against immigrants may be cruel, but his actions are crueler, particularly the pattern of tearing children away from their refugee parents at the border and sending them to foster care. And his efforts to curb reproductive health programs, which will leave more women dying agonizing deaths from cervical cancer. And his lifting of environmental regulations, causing more infants in farm states to suffer brain damage from the Dow Chemical Companys nerve gas pesticide.In other words, the biggest Trump scandals arent those unfolding in Washington, but those devastating the lives of the poor and vulnerable in distant American towns.Theres some danger, I think, that progressives come to care primarily about issues where Trump is involved, allowing him to define the agenda. For example, the best single way to break cycles of poverty is probably with early childhood programs for at-risk kids, but because Trump doesnt care about this, liberals dont seem much interested, either. Thats pathetic.We can cover Trump and other things as well, and the best evidence is #MeToo. The #MeToo cascade drew on anger at how Trump prevailed even after boasting about sexually assaulting women, but it shined the spotlight elsewhere and had astonishing consequences that are still reverberating around the world.In short, think of this as a multifront war. Trump is mounting one assault on our values, institutions and policies, and we have to fight back. But if we battle only on that front, we are in effect surrendering everywhere else.
