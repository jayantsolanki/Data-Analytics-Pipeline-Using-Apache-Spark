Why did white working-class voters shift toward Donald Trump in the 2016 election? Was it about money or culture  their struggles in the new economy or their prejudices?A recent article in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by Diana C. Mutz comes down on the side of culture. Dr. Mutz studied the responses of voters who were interviewed in October 2012 and October 2016, focusing on those who switched their support from Barack Obama to Mr. Trump. She argues that these white voters turned to Mr. Trump not because their economic situation had deteriorated but because they were increasingly anxious about whether they could hold on to their dominant social position.Other scholars have made similar claims. A report based on a 2016 national survey concluded that the white-working-class tilt toward Mr. Trump occurred because of fears of cultural displacement rather than economic hardship. Three political scientists argued that the shift represented an identity crisis among whites without college educations that was rooted in their fear that African-Americans and immigrants were undermining their position as the majority group.These conclusions, faithful as they may be to the survey data that underlie them, exemplify a misguided debate about whether culture or economics was the driving force in Mr. Trumps win. To be sure, racism is a corrosive part of American culture and politics. Nevertheless, those who try to distinguish between the explanatory power of stagnant wages and a declining industrial base on the one hand, and anxieties about the ascent of minority groups on the other, miss the point: These are not two different factors but two sides of the same coin.[Receive the days most urgent debates right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter.]College-educated Americans speak about the economic problems of the working class in terms of trends that can be seen in tables and graphs. Those on the left criticize the federal minimum wage as being too low, while those on the right bemoan the erosion of work incentives. But the people who are experiencing these adverse economic trends express themselves differently, using a moral language that is often rooted in attitudes about work and race.This was first noted by the sociologist Michle Lamont in her book The Dignity of Working Men. She found that white working-class men often define their self-worth through their ability to lead disciplined, responsible lives. They take pride in going to work every day to support their families. Many of them view African-Americans as not wanting to work hard. They rarely consider that their own advantages rest on the privileged position of whites in the labor market.In this way, they construct a positive sense of self despite the limits of their economic class. Perched precariously above the poor, they talk not about their modest incomes but rather about their superior work discipline. In prosperous times, they can take pride in their success compared with minorities.But when that prosperity is threatened, they complain about blacks or immigrants who are, in their minds, usurping their place in the economy. In a 2017 survey, 24 percent of whites without college degrees responded that they had been personally discriminated against in applying for jobs because they were white  although strong evidence exists that it is actually blacks who are discriminated against.The economic distress of the white working class has been building since the 1970s. What was new in 2016 was a candidate, Mr. Trump, who spoke about that distress not in the language of a college graduate but as a working-class person might. He exploited voters feeling that they were being left behind by a Democratic Party that seemingly favored blacks and immigrants.In addition, when white working-class individuals do talk about their standard of living, its not necessarily those with the lowest incomes who speak the loudest. More important than how much they earn is their sense of how they are doing compared with the standard of living of their parents generation. Those who see themselves as downwardly mobile are the unhappiest.Working-class whites with steady employment may nevertheless consider themselves worse off because their parents made high, unionized wages that are mostly out of reach today. Those with lower incomes may not have expected as much. In other words, what matters is not the size of your paycheck but whether it allows for the standard of living you think you are entitled to.The debate over why the white working class supported Mr. Trump raises a question: Why do we care so much about determining precisely how much political upheaval is due to economics and how much is due to culture?Perhaps we are drawn to this futile quest because economic problems seem more tractable  more easily dealt with through the levers of government policy  while cultural issues seem more resistant to change. Perhaps it is because peoples economic troubles are often said to reflect larger, structural problems beyond their control, whereas their cultural deficiencies are sometimes seen as their own fault. When academics and journalists want to express affinity with the working class, in other words, they focus on poverty, and when they dont, they focus on prejudice.Controversy over economic versus cultural explanations of poverty can be traced to 1966, when the anthropologist Oscar Lewis, in his book La Vida, on Puerto Ricans in New York, wrote of a culture of poverty that seemed impervious to change.Today, however, astute scholars do not see a wall between economics and culture. They acknowledge that financial hardship affects the daily lives of working-class Americans, but they add that how they respond is based on cultural beliefs that may lead them to scapegoat minority groups.People with unstable or insufficient incomes may express their fears by talking about race because that is the way they have learned to interpret the world. People who are frustrated by their lack of progress may still try to defend the dignity of their work. It is a mistake to see economics and culture as distinct forces. Both propelled Mr. Trump to victory.
