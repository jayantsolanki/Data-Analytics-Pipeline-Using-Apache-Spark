To the Editor:Re President Loses Grip on His Own Story (news analysis, front page, May 4):Robert Mueller, the special counsel, wants President Trump to tell what he knows of the matters under investigation. Mr. Trumps lawyers see that as a perjury trap only because they know the president will have to lie or incriminate himself.HELEN HERBER, EVANSTON, ILL.To the Editor:Re What Robert Mueller Knows (editorial, May 2):Dont be fooled. President Trump has no intention of sitting down with Robert Mueller to answer questions. His statement that hell do so is nothing more than his usual braggadocio. In the end, hell say that his attorneys are barring him from doing so.MYRNA LUECK, YPSILANTI, MICH.
