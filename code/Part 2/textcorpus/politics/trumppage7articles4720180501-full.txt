AUSTIN, Texas  Texas and six other states are suing to end once and for all a program that would protect some young immigrants from deportation.The lawsuit announced Tuesday comes a week after a federal judge in Washington ordered the Trump administration to resume the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.Immigrants under the Obama-era program are commonly referred to as "Dreamers." Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton had threatened legal action for the past year if the program didn\'t come to a halt.Joining Texas in the lawsuit are Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Carolina and West Virginia.A federal judge in Washington called the Department of Homeland Security\'s rationale against the program "arbitrary and capricious." He gave the Trump administration 90 days to make a new case.Tuesday\'s lawsuit joins a host of litigation related to the program that is not expected to be resolved until the U.S. Supreme Court weighs in.
