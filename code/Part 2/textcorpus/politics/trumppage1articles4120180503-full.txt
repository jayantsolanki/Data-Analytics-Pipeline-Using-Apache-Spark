To the Editor: Feeling It Has an Edge, China Sets a Hard Line on U.S. Trade Demands (news article, May 1) reveals the Trump administrations weak negotiating position.For the United States to demand that China scale back its $300 billion plan to bankroll the countrys industrial upgrade into advanced technologies like artificial intelligence, semiconductors, electric cars and commercial aircraft is equivalent to my asking my neighbors to curb their vocational ambitions, limit their childrens education and stop saving for retirement.An economically robust China is in the long-term interests of the world, and particularly the United States. The times they are a-changin, and we have to adapt. Weve done it before. President Trumps preposterous demand is a losers whine that the competition is unfair because his competitor is better at it.MARK MILLER, SAN FRANCISCO
