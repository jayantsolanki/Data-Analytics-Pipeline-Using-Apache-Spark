To the Editor:Re President May Plead Fifth to Mueller, Giuliani Says (news article, May 7):As a former federal prosecutor and then a longtime defense lawyer, I believe that there is a unanimity of lawyers mentioned in various articles that the president should not talk with the special prosecutor.A lawyers duty is to advise, but the ultimate decision is the clients. How it will look for a president to take the Fifth may be more important than any other consideration, especially a president who says that only the guilty take the Fifth.ROBERT LERNER, MILWAUKEETo the Editor:Regarding the acknowledgment that Donald Trump funded the hush payment to Stormy Daniels, Mr. Trump has always claimed to be a fighter and to hit back 10 times harder. He has said this about the American military response to ISIS, and his wife, Melania, has indicated that he has the same philosophy in his personal life. But now we see him capitulating to what he claims is a false accusation.The lesson to be learned from this is that President Trump is not the fighter he pretended to be during the campaign, but that hes actually someone who folds when credibly accused. His base, who thinks that he will fight for it, should realize that hes not going to fight for it if he wont fight for himself.GREG BELCAMINO, NEW YORK
