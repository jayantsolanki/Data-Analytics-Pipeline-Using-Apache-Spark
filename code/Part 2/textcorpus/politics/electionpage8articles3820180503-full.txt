ROME  Italy\'s president has summoned the country\'s bickering political leaders to a single day of talks on Monday to seek a way out of a two-month political impasse.President Sergio Mattarella\'s office said Thursday that the latest round of talks to develop a government coalition between the populist 5-Star Movement and the center-left Democratic Party had "faded." He said after five rounds of talks "no prospective of a government majority has emerged."Reports have suggested that Mattarella could resort to appointing a "truce" government to lead Italy through 2018 to pass the budget, and hold a new election in 2019.A center-right coalition won 37 percent of Italy\'s March 4 vote and the anti-establishment, populist 5-Stars nabbed 32 percent. But the 5-Stars have refused to govern with ex-Premier Silvio Berlusconi\'s Forza Italia, a key member of the center-right coalition.The other main center-right force, the anti-immigrant, populist League party, had entertained a possible alliance with the 5-Stars. But League leader Matteo Salvini refused to break with Berlusconi, and of late has been locked in a war of words with 5-Star leader Luigi di Maio.The Democratic Party, for its part, has fractured between forces willing to negotiate with the 5-Stars and those loyal to ex-Premier Matteo Renzi, who has ruled out any deal. A party meeting on Thursday was expected to lay those divisions bare.Mattarella\'s office said the single day of talks Monday would "try to see if the parties have other perspectives for a governing majority."
