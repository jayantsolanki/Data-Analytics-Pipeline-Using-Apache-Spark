To the Editor:Re Giuliani Asserts Trump Refunded Payment to Star (front page, May 3):So, Rudolph W. Giuliani says the $130,000 hush money payment that Michael Cohen made to a pornographic film actress was eventually paid by Donald Trump, who had previously declared that he knew nothing about any payment or where the money came from, thereby absolving Michael Cohen of any Trump campaign finance law violation, but now opening the possibility that Mr. Trump may have violated campaign finance laws.Oh, what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive (Sir Walter Scott).LOUIS A. DEACETISPORT WASHINGTON, N.Y.To the Editor:Donald Trump is hardly the first president or politician to lie to the American people about his sexcapades. Bill Clinton was a master at that game. But with Mr. Clinton, at least as far as we know, he didnt pay anyone through back-channel fixers to keep them quiet  all in order to influence a campaign.Mr. Trumps dismissal of hush money payments and nondisclosure agreements as no big deal (very common among celebrities and people of wealth) reeks of entitlement and sexism, but hed be foolish to think the American people and the justice system wont figure out why Stormy Daniels got paid out.This whole episode is sadly emblematic of our morally compromised president, and the party that continues to defend him.CODY LYON, BROOKLYNTo the Editor:For those who regard the United States attorneys office for the Southern District of New York as a model of what a prosecutors office should be, it was distressing to see the former leader of that office, Rudolph Giuliani, telling Sean Hannity that F.B.I. agents acting under the supervision of that office were storm troopers. Et tu, Brute?JOHN S. MARTIN JR., NEW YORKThe writer was the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York from 1980 to 1983.
