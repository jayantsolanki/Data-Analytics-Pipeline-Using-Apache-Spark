BRUSSELS  The head of the European Union\'s executive has warned the United States that the bloc will not negotiate trade concessions under threat, a day after President Donald Trump granted the EU only a one-month extension on steel and aluminum tariffs.EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told the European Parliament Wednesday that the exemption should be "unconditional and permanent."Juncker added that "this should not happen between allies."The 28-country EU has warned that it will retaliate if Trump goes ahead with the tariffs by May 31, a development that could set off a trans-Atlantic trade war."We will continue our negotiations with the U.S. but we will refuse to negotiate under threat," Juncker said. "We are now, pure and simple, calling for their withdrawal."
