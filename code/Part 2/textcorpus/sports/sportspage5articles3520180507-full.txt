The N.F.L. Players Association filed a grievance against the league on behalf of Eric Reid on Monday.Reid, a former San Francisco 49ers safety who has knelt during the national anthem at games for the past two seasons, had filed a grievance of his own last week against the N.F.L., saying the league had blackballed him because of his actions. After becoming a free agent following the 2017 season, he has yet to find a new team.The former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who led a wave of sideline demonstrations against social injustice and police brutality against African-Americans, filed a similar grievance last season. It is still being adjudicated.The players association said in a statement that the collective bargaining agreement had been violated in Reids case. It contended that A club appears to have based its decision not to sign a player based on the players statement that he would challenge the implementation of a clubs policy prohibiting demonstration.It also claimed that at least one club owner has asked pre-employment interview questions about a players intent to demonstrate. We believe these questions are improper, given league policy.The union did not identify the teams involved. Reid is known to have met with the Bengals.The N.F.L. did not immediately reply to a request for comment. It had declined to comment after Reid filed his grievance last week.
