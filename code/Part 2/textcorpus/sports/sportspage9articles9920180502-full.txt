MERIDIAN TOWNSHIP, Mich.  Authorities in a Michigan community have reopened seven sexual assault cases, prompted by a 2004 abuse report that failed to result in charges against now-disgraced Michigan State University sports doctor Larry Nassar.Meridian Township Police Chief Dave Hall says Wednesday that nearly 600 cases reported over 17 years have been reviewed and the seven reopened cases will be given to prosecutors. None of the cases involves Nassar.Hall said police looked at the old cases to see if anything was missed. The seven reopened cases had not previously been submitted to prosecutors.Brianne Randall-Gay was 17 when she told police in 2004 that Nassar had molested her during an appointment. The township is near the Michigan State campus. Meridian Township police dropped the case after Nassar insisted he performed a legitimate procedure.Township officials later apologized and said police were deceived. And her complaint about Nassar prompted Township officials to begin looking at older cases that did not involve him.Nassar also was a doctor for the U.S. women's Olympic gymnastics team. He is serving decades in prison.___This version of the story corrects the headline to make clear that the seven reopened cases, and the 600 cases examined did not involve Nassar.
