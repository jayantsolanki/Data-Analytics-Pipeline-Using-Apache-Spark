(Reuters) - A strong finish to West Bromwich Albion\'s campaign despite their expected relegation from the Premier League can convince more players to pledge their future to the club, goalkeeper Ben Foster has said.Under caretaker boss Darren Moore, West Brom have two wins in four games, more than the one victory they managed under sacked boss Alan Pardew in 18 matches."I hope this run will have convinced a few more players to stick around and help the cause even if we do have to rebuild and bring players in," Foster told the Express and Star.West Brom are bottom of the table with 28 points, five off safety with two games remaining but the 35-year-old Foster has already pledged his future to the club and is hopeful more of his team mates will follow suit.Foster pointed to the experience of Newcastle United who retained their best players and manager Rafa Benitez to return to the top-flight immediately after dropping down to the Championship."Going down with momentum can be powerful, as Newcastle showed a couple of years ago," Foster added."That will affect the calibre of who we bring in... we\'ve got a few players who have already said that they\'ll be here next season no matter what and try to help us get back up."West Brom take on fourth-placed Tottenham Hotspur in the league on Saturday.
