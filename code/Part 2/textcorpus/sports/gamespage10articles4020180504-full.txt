(Reuters) - Leicester City manager Claude Puel has received the full backing of club chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha following a poor run of results in the Premier League.Frenchman Puel, who replaced the sacked Craig Shakespeare in October, has guided Leicester to ninth in the standings with 44 points from 35 games. The team has struggled for form in recent weeks, however, losing three of their last four matches.Leicester\'s Thai chairman visited Puel at the club\'s training ground on Friday to offer his support amid media reports of player unrest."The message from the owner is clear for all. It\'s important to finish strongly and to respect the club, the owners and the fans," Puel told a news conference ahead of Saturday\'s league clash at home against 15th-placed West Ham United."I\'m not under pressure. I\'m pragmatic. I know my work, I know what we need to do, what we want for the end of the season, for next season, but of course it\'s important to try and bring together this energy."The former Southampton boss said he was not surprised by the vote of confidence."We had a lot of discussions to prepare for next season... I think it\'s important," Puel added. "It\'s not just about me, it is support for all the people in the club. He (Srivaddhanaprabha) has confidence in all the people working for him."
