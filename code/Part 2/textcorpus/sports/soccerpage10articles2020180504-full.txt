(Reuters) - Everton striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin will miss the final two games of the Premier League season with a back injury, manager Sam Allardyce said on Friday.Calvert-Lewin failed a late fitness test to miss the clash with Huddersfield Town last weekend and the 21-year-old will not feature against Southampton and West Ham United."Calvert-Lewin is out. He\'s unfortunately got a small stress fracture at the bottom of his back," Allardyce told reporters ahead of Saturday\'s home game against 18th-placed Saints. Defender Mason Holgate is back in training after shaking off an ankle injury that has kept him out since March but will not be ready for the clash with Mark Hughes\' side.Everton are eighth in the table with 48 points after 13 wins, nine draws and 14 defeats. Allardyce added the club was already working on strengthening the squad for next season."If you look at where we were last season and this we are around the eighth mark. It all depends on the recruitment and what the type of quality is that we can bring," Allardyce said."Plans are in place. Names are on lists, yes, but can we achieve it? It\'s a volatile market. With the market closing before the season starts and the World Cup, it is tough." (Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; Editing by Christian Radnedge)
