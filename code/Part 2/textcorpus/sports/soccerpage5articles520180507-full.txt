BARCELONA, Spain  Barcelona and Real Madrid showed Sunday that they dont need titles at stake to produce a thrilling game.With Barcelona having already clinched the Spanish league title and Madrid focused on its Champions League final later this month, it was supposed to be the most low-key Clsico in years.Instead, the Camp Nou was treated to a heated contest and four goals, including Lionel Messis strike that ensured Barcelona salvaged a 2-2 draw despite playing a man down for the whole second half and remained undefeated in the league this season.When asked if the match had lived up to its decaffeinated billing, Barcelona Coach Ernesto Valverde said: Decaf? It had extra caffeine. Both sides always want to win a game like this.Ronaldo also scored and gave Madrids fans a scare when he sustained a leg injury and needed to be substituted at halftime. Ronaldo took a knock to his lower right leg when he scored in the 14th minute, canceling out Luis Surezs opener in the 10th minute.Madrid was dominating the match when Barcelona right back Sergi Roberto was shown a direct red card during first-half injury time for swiping his hand at Madrid defender Marcelos face as tempers flared.But Messi came to the hosts rescue, sending the ball past Keylor Navas in the 52nd minute to swing the match back in Barcelonas favor despite playing a man down.Gareth Bale pulled Madrid level in the 72nd after curling in a pass by substitute Marco Asensio.Madrid Coach Zinedine Zidane said that he wasnt worried about Ronaldo being able to play in the Champions League final against Liverpool on May 26.He doesnt feel good now, but I dont think it is anything serious, Zidane said. We will have him ready.Barcelona stayed unbeaten through 35 league matches this season and extended its record run to 42 consecutive games without a loss.Barcelona has three matches left to become the first team to go unbeaten in the competition since the 1930s, when it consisted of 10 teams, compared to 20 now.Our quest continues to finish the league without a loss, said Andrs Iniesta, who played his 38th and final game against Madrid before he leaves Barcelona after 16 seasons this summer.Even though nothing was at stake, both teams played with all the emotion of a final.While Madrid played its best after Surez briefly put Barcelona ahead, Barcelona regrouped after Roberto was sent off.Barcelona began to lose its composure after Ronaldos goal, and Jordi Alba shoved Luka Modric before both Surez and Sergio Ramos were booked for a tussle.Messi earned himself a yellow for a hard tackle on Ramos before Roberto responded to Marcelos bump from behind by slapping at his face. Marcelo fell down and the referee didnt hesitate in flashing the red card for Roberto.But halftime changed everything.Ronaldo stayed on the bench and, without its star, Madrid couldnt impose its numerical advantage.Suarez won the ball back from Raphal Varane after a side-to-side collision and passed to Messi, who used a blistering strike of his left boot to drive the ball just inside the post.That goal took Messis Clsico record to 26 goals.Messi looked poised to get another goal, but instead Bale made it 2-2 by using one touch to curl Asensios pass around Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-Andr Ter Stegen.Barcelonas players held an impromptu celebration on the pitch for the result and its domestic double, with the coaching staff giving them the guard of honor that Madrids players declined to do before kickoff.
