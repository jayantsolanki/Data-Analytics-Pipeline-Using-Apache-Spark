(Reuters) - Huddersfield Town must embrace the challenge of playing three top-six teams in their remaining games to secure their Premier League status, manager David Wagner said on Friday.Huddersfield are 16th in the table with 35 points from as many games and sit three points above the drop zone. However, they face a potentially difficult finish to the campaign with games against Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal.Huddersfield have one victory in seven games coming into Sunday\'s clash with champions City but the manager said his team were not worried ahead of an "exciting" few weeks for the club."We have now three great opponents and exciting matches in front of us. In other countries you have to qualify for the Champions League to play opponents like this," Wagner told a news conference.Huddersfield are playing in their first top-flight season in 45 years after coming through the Championship playoffs. They began the current campaign strongly but have since been plagued by inconsistency."Nobody expected us to stay up, three games to go and we have everything in our hands. We are fighting and we have a big chance to reach an unbelievable target, to finish our miracle and this is how it is."We worked our socks off last year at Wembley to play these opponents and now we start to get worried about it... it makes absolutely no sense."
