MADRID  Real Madrid will not give La Liga champions Barcelona a guard of honour when the sides meet in El Clasico, coach Zinedine Zidane said on Saturday.Barcelona wrapped up the title last weekend and face European champions Real on Sunday. After the Club World Cup they didnt want to do it for us, Zidane told a news conference. They might have said they didnt do it because they werent in the competition, but thats not true. Youve got to win the Champions League to play in it and were both in the Champions League. Its not up to me to decide about the guard of honour but they didnt do it. We, with respect, wont do it for them because they didnt. We respect what Barca have done in winning the league, which for me is the most difficult and nicest thing you can do. But these things happen; if theyd have given us one, we werent going to break the tradition of doing so. The incident Zidane was referring to happened before the Clasico on Dec. 23 when, having returned from the United Arab Emirates as Club World Cup winners, Barcelona elected not to give Real a guard of honour as is traditional in Spain.Barca won the match 3-0. Real, third in the table, secured their place in this months Champions League final on Tuesday and are aiming to win the trophy for the third year in a row but Zidane is planning to name a full-strength side against Barcelona.While the game wont change the league positions, we still want to play well and do everything we can to win," he said. If theres players who still feel knocks, they wont play, but weve got a lot of options to replace them. (Raphael) Varane and Isco should be fine to travel. Sundays meeting will be the final time Barca midfielder Andres Iniesta plays in the fixture having announced he will leave the Catalans at the end of the season. Hes a player we admire, not just any other player, and we all know how he is as a person, Zidane said. Well shake his hand, congratulate him and wish him luck for the future. (Editing by Ed Osmond)
