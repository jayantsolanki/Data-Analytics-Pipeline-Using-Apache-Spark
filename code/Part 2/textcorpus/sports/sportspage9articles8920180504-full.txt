(Reuters) - West Bromwich Albion could be relegated from the Premier League this weekend but caretaker manager Darren Moore is only focused on extending a recent positive run when they host Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday.West Brom must beat Tottenham to stand any chance of avoiding relegation to the Championship (second tier) but they could go down even with victory if either Southampton or Swansea City win their respective matches at Everton and Bournemouth this weekend.The Baggies, who are bottom of the table and five points behind 17th-placed Swansea having played one game more, have won two and drawn two of their league matches under Moore and the interim boss is eager for his side to continue their recent good form."What we are doing here is just focusing on the next game," Moore told reporters. "Anything else that happens away from that... I can\'t manage that."We\'ve hit some good form recently and we want to continue that. This is a tough game for us against Spurs. I\'m focusing on preparing us for the game."Any team you face in the Premier League pose threats. Collectively as a group we have to come together to work hard to get a result. It\'s the last home game of the season and we want to give a good account of ourselves."Goalkeeper Ben Foster was among a host of players and pundits to praise Moore in recent weeks and the 44-year-old, who is in charge of West Brom until the end of the season, welcomed the support."Support from anywhere is excellent really," Moore added. "It\'s excellent to have it from players and staff within."It shows that we are supporting each other and continuing to support each other... To have support, from any department of the club, has to be a positive."Midfielders James Morrison (Achilles tendon) and Gareth Barry (knee) are the only doubts for West Brom as the club look to get their first home league win since January.West Brom travel to Crystal Palace for their final Premier League match of the season on May 13.
