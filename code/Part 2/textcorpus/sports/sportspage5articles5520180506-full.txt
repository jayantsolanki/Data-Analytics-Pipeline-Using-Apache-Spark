PARIS  Olympique Lyonnais took another step towards finishing second in Ligue 1 and claiming a Champions League spot as Bertrand Traore's double led them to a 3-0 home win against relegation-threatened Troyes on Sunday.Traore struck twice in the first half and Maxwell Cornet wrapped up the win late on to take Lyon to 75 points with two games left, one ahead of third-placed Monaco who won 2-1 away with a Moussa Sylla double at Caen, who finished with 10 men.Olympique de Marseille are a further point behind in fourth after Dimitri Payet showed his class with the winning goal after an earlier assist in a 2-1 home win against Nice. The top three teams qualify for next season's Champions League.The most dramatic game was played at Metz who lost 2-1 and were relegated after conceding two stoppage-time goals to Angers. The defeat left the hosts on 26 points, eight adrift of Toulouse in the relegation playoff spot with two games left.Toulouse suffered a 3-2 defeat at home to Lille who moved up to 16th on 35 points, leaving their victims in 18th with 34.At Lyons Groupama stadium, Traore scored in the 28th minute with a clever back heel and doubled their tally seven minutes later, heading home from Ferland Mendys cross.The result left Troyes in 19th place, two points behind the relegation playoff spot.Monaco's Sylla opening the scoring in the 13th minute against Caen after Rony Lopes' shot bounced off the post.But the hosts hit back five minutes from the break as Ivan Santini curled a superb shot into the top corner.Caen had goalkeeper Romain Genevois sent off after 77 minutes for a foul on Jordi Mboula as he raced towards goal. The Normandy side cracked one minute into added time as Sylla scored from close range after a poor clearance by Remy Vercoutre.In Sunday's late game at Marseille's Velodrome, Payet secured the points against Nice after 74 minutes having collected a fine pass from Clinton Njie.Visiting striker Mario Balotelli had opened the scoring in the fifth minute after dribbling past Rolando but Marseille's Valere Germain equalised in the 13th after latching onto a cross from France international Payet, who has been in good form. Paris St Germain, who have already won the title, were held to a 2-2 draw at Amiens on Friday. (Reporting by Julien Pretot; Editing by Ken Ferris)
