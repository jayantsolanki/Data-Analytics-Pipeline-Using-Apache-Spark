A look at what's happening all around the majors Wednesday:___STREAKING KLUBERCleveland right-hander Corey Kluber is 4-1 going into Wednesday's game against Texas and has won four consecutive starts. His 2.18 ERA is the lowest through April for an Indians pitcher with at least 40 innings since Tom Candiotti's 2.13 ERA in 1988. He had a three-hit shutout last Friday against Seattle before Kyle Seager's two-out single in the ninth and was taken out in favor of closer Cody Allen. Kluber struck out 10, reaching double figures for the 41st time. Rangers starter Matt Moore has cut his ERA from 11.05 to 5.33 in his past four games, including three starts.___DEGROMINATORNew York Mets right-hander Jacob deGrom is 3-0 with a 2.06 ERA and has thrown 14 1/3 consecutive scoreless innings going into Wednesday's start against Atlanta and Sean Newcomb. DeGrom has allowed only one extra-base hit to a right-handed batter this season. He pitched seven shutout innings with 10 strikeouts in a no-decision April 21 at Atlanta. The 2014 NL Rookie of the Year is 5-3 with a 1.99 ERA in 12 starts vs. the Braves, including a 1.38 mark in four outings at home, and hasn't lost to them since June 2016.___BACK IN THE BIG LEAGUESWade Miley returns to the major leagues and is scheduled to start for Milwaukee at Cincinnati.
