(Reuters) - West Ham United must learn from last weekend\'s defeat by champions Manchester City and approach Saturday\'s Premier League trip to Leicester City with confidence, goalkeeper Adrian has said.Sunday\'s defeat was West Ham\'s second consecutive 4-1 loss in the league and left the London club in danger of being dragged further into the relegation battle during the run-in.West Ham sit three points and positions above 18th-placed Southampton with three league games left in the campaign."Leicester is an opponent more in our league. We have to get points as soon as possible and we will move onto the next one," Adrian told West Ham\'s website https://www.whufc.com. "We can\'t forget the City game because we have to learn from our mistakes, but we have to go to Leicester with maximum confidence and strength to get the three points there."Adrian, 31, replaced Joe Hart in goal after the heavy defeat at Arsenal the previous week but the change failed to shore up West Ham\'s leaky defence as they suffered another drubbing by City. Despite the result, the Spaniard is hopeful of being in contention to start at Leicester."It\'s hard when you concede four goals and you can\'t be happy with the result, but I\'m happy to be back in the team and playing again after a few games out," Adrian added."I will work hard to give the manager a decision for the next one and I hope I can play until the end of the season."The best thing in football is that you have another game and we have our next one on Saturday and we need to give our best."To add to West Ham\'s worries, British media reported that striker Andy Carroll was sent home from training on Monday after an argument with manager David Moyes, leaving the 29-year-old\'s participation in the climax to the season uncertain.Leicester are ninth in the standings and have lost three of their last four league games, the most recent of which was last weekend\'s 5-0 defeat at Crystal Palace.
