In addition to his athletic team duties, Strauss also worked at the university medical center and student health center, the university said.Thursday\'s update followed last month\'s initial announcement that someone recently had come forward to accuse Strauss of sexual misconduct."We are sharing this information to encourage our community past and present to come forward," university spokesman Chris Davey said. "We believe the more information that we have, it will aid in the investigation."The university has hired Seattle-based law firm Perkins Coie to conduct an independent investigation. It also has referred the matter to Columbus police and the Franklin County Prosecutor\'s Office for a potential criminal investigation.The Associated Press could not locate any relatives of Strauss who could be asked to comment on the allegations.Strauss was an associate professor of medicine at Ohio State.An article in the campus newspaper from 1984 said he was selected to test Olympic athletes for illegal drug use during the summer games in Los Angeles.Other articles published during the 1980s said Strauss studied injury rates among wrestlers and other athletes, as well as the effects of steroid use.The timing of the allegations ranges from the mid-1970s through the late 1990s, Strauss\' tenure at Ohio State.___Andrew Welsh-Huggins can be reached on Twitter at https://twitter.com/awhcolumbus.
