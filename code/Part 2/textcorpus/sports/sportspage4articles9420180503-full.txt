LOS ANGELES  Katrina Prendergast and Ellen Secor turned a late deficit into a Colorado State rally to capture their first USGA title.The duo won three straight holes late in the championship match of the U.S. Women's Amateur Four-Ball against teenagers Yachun Chang and Lei Ye and pulled off a 1-up victory at El Caballero Country Club in Tarzana.In chilly, windy conditions Wednesday in the San Fernando Valley, Ye and Chang appeared to seize control by winning the 13th and 14th holes for a 2-up lead.The Colorado State teammates won the 15th hole with a par. Secor holed a 12-foot birdie putt on the par-3 16th hole to square the match for the fifth time. They took the lead on the par-5 17th when Prendergast two-putted from long range for birdie.Ye missed a 7-foot birdie putt on the final hole that would have forced extra hole.It's the second straight year college teammates have won the event. Taylor Totland and Alice Chen of Furman won last year.Colorado State coach Annie Thurman also has a USGA heritage, with a victory in U.S. Women's Amateur Public Links in 2002 and a win with the 2004 Curtis Cup team.Prendergast and Secor now head to Austin, Texas, for the NCAA regionals, where they are competing as individuals.
