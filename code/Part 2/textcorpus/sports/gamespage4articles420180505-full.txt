VARIETY PUZZLE  Fred Piscop is back with a very tricky Split Decisions puzzle. For each unclued entry, youre given two pairs of letters and a varying number of blank spaces; to solve, you must find the letters to fill those spaces that make two separate words.At its smallest, an entry can be something like this puzzles EW/AY __, which means that you must come up with one letter for that space that will create a word EW__ and a word AY__ . That letter must be E, to get EWE and AYE. On the vertical edges today, the longest entries appear: My favorite was MA/PI __ __ __ __ __ __ , which came out as two fish, which I found very clever.The first entry I filled in as I sallied forth was at CR/GL __ __. I entered OW to make crow and glow and figured that was a wrap. It wasnt until Id gotten much farther into the puzzle that o wasnt working, and I figured out that CRIB and GLIB went there. That was my only true misfire, but I spent an inordinate amount of time working on the whole left side of this puzzle.The bottom row today had some really good twosies, I thought: I especially liked Captain Caption, a possible character in a newsroom cartoon. I wont spoil the rest of them but there were two others that were really smart.The very last entry to fall was at __ __ __ ZE/RT; at a certain point I knew that the second blank was an m, which made amaze work, and smart, but never the twain could meet until I very grudgingly took to xwordinfo.com and looked up SMAZE. Yep, it is a thing, actually a pollutant thats also a portmanteau, thank you very much. Im impressed by all of you who cheerfully entered that. If I could have made smirt work Id have gone with smirt and smize instead, as Im more familiar with smize, although it doesnt seem to be a puzzle entry yet.What did you think?
