MADRID  With the La Liga title already in the bag, Barcelona still want to win Sunday\'s Clasico meeting with Real Madrid and preserve their unbeaten record in the campaign, coach Ernesto Valverde said on Saturday.A Clasico is a Clasico and at the end of the day its an important game in the season, Valverde told a news conference.Luckily for us, were champions already. Obviously, we want to win, irrelevant of the table -- and they will too, given the situation and our rivalry.Theyll come with the idea of ending our unbeaten streak and hopefully itll be a good game." Barca sealed the La Liga crown with a 4-2 win at Deportivo La Coruna last Sunday, meaning pride is all that is at stake when they face third-placed Real at the Nou Camp.I wish all Clasicos had a decaffeinated flavour because of the fact we were already champions," said Valverde. "Maybe observers would be more up for it if the gap was just one point and there was more at play, but Im happy the way it is.Valverde played down Real\'s decision not to give Barca a guard of honour as champions, as is traditional in Spain.Real coach Zinedine Zidane told a news conference earlier on Saturday: "We, with respect, won\'t do it for them because they didn\'t," referring to Barca\'s decision not to give their rivals a guard of honour at the Dec. 23 Clasico after they won the Club World Cup.Weve spoken a lot about this, Valverde said. Its something that, for all the talking thats gone on about it, will not have any importance, Im sure of it. I think its fine, and thats that. Were not going to give it any importance.I dont have any doubt that tomorrow well see the best two teams possible on behalf of both Barca and Real Madrid, he added.Sunday will be the final time that Barcelona captain Andres Iniesta faces arch-rivals Real, having confirmed his departure at the end of the season.I know that people are talking about it because tomorrows game is so important but its not his last game," Valverde said.Weve got three games left with him and the important one will be the last one he plays.
