(Reuters) - Southampton\'s win over Bournemouth last weekend has given the relegation-threatened club extra strength to tackle the season\'s final run-in, midfielder Oriol Romeu said ahead of Saturday\'s Premier League trip to Everton.Midfielder Dusan Tadic scored a brace to lead Southampton to a 2-1 victory over Bournemouth at St. Mary\'s, which helped the 18th-placed side move to within a point of safety with three league matches remaining."This victory gives us extra strength to carry on now, to do something nice and finish where we want to finish," Romeu is quoted as saying by the Daily Echo."Winning makes you feel like you can win games, that we have fight enough to be there and to stay up."We are going to feel relaxed but we need to prepare for the next game because it does not give you too long to rest. The next one will be as important as this one so we have to go again."Southampton are aiming to win consecutive league games for the first time this season when they travel to Merseyside and also achieve a double over Everton having beat them 4-1 at home earlier this season.Manager Mark Hughes\' side have won just two of their last 22 league matches but Romeu believes two victories from their remaining three games will be enough to avoid relegation."Hopefully two wins will do," the Spaniard said. "The other opponents have difficult games coming and it is not going to be easy for them..."We make our maths but I think we need to win two of our three games and draw the last one. That will make us safer because we don\'t want to think of other results, we have to think of ourselves."Southampton travel to fellow strugglers Swansea City and host champions Manchester City in their final matches.
