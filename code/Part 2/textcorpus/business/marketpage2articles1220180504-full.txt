BRUSSELS  U.S. cable company Liberty Global has offered concessions to win over EU antitrust regulators which are examining its takeover of Dutch peer Ziggo for the second time after an EU court threw out its 2014 approval of the deal.Former state telecoms monopoly KPN had complained to the court about the combined market power of Liberty Global's Dutch unit UPC and Ziggo, the two largest cable network operators in the Netherlands.Liberty Global submitted its proposal on May 3, according to a filing on the European Commission site. No details were provided in line with EU policy. It will decide by May 30 whether to clear the bid after getting feedback from third parties.The company offered to sell its premium pay TV film channel Film1 and scrapped clauses which restrict broadcasters' ability to sell their channels and content over the internet.The Luxembourg-based General Court, Europe's second-highest, in October last year rejected the Commission's ruling because it had failed to properly explain the effects of the merger on the market for pay TV sports channels.Liberty Global has since joined forces with Vodafone in the Netherlands to create VodafoneZiggo.
