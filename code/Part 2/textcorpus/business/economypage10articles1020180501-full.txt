DUBLIN  Ireland's unemployment rate fell below 6 percent for the first time in a decade when it dropped to 5.9 percent in April from 6 percent a month earlier, data from the central statistics office showed on Tuesday. Unemployment was last below that level in May 2008 just as Ireland's economic crisis bit, doubling the rate of joblessness in less than a year and swelling it to a peak of 16 percent by 2012.The rate has fallen steadily since and Ireland's finance department forecast last month that it would fall to 5.3 percent next year and hold steady there the following year as the economy reaches full employment.
