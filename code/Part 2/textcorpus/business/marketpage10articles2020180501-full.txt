LONDON  Britain's Debt Management Office said on Tuesday it planned to sell a new conventional gilt maturing in 2071 via syndication in the week starting May 14, subject to market conditions.The October 2071 gilt will extend the UK gilt curve by more than three years, though the gilt will have a shorter maturity at launch than was the case for the current longest-dated gilt, the July 2068 <GBT3H68=>, which set the record when it was first sold in June 2013.The DMO added that more details, including the composition of the syndicate and the bond's coupon, would be announced nearer the launch date.
