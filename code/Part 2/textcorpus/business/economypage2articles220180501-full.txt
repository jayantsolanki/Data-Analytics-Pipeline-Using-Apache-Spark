To the Editor:In A Time for Big Economic Ideas (column, April 23), David Leonhardt briefly mentions infrastructure as one solution for our woes. How about increasing spending on badly needed projects in every state with unneeded military bases by closing them but keeping the money in the state, shifting it dollar for dollar to any infrastructure projects of the states choosing?This way you get around politicians reflexive veto on closing unneeded bases. Either reassign the military personnel or allow force reduction through natural attrition. Give first dibs on any new employment to civilians currently working on the bases set to be closed.Returning the land to the state for development opportunities would also allow the raising of additional revenues through the sale or lease of land and property, sales and use taxes.The plan is bipartisan, and it lowers unnecessary military spending while increasing domestic economic stimulus without raising taxes. It also reduces a federal presence, which some people object to anyway. Call it the New Deal for the 21st Century or some other sexy thing.CLIFFORD M. SHATZ FOXBOROUGH, MASS.To the Editor:It is not big ideas that are in short supply; its politicians big enough to see past their next election cycle.The current crop of Republicans seems to be against government doing anything besides spending on the military and cutting taxes for the superrich, while  for resulting budgetary reasons  shrinking social welfare and other programs the rest of us depend on.Instead of big ideas, we seem to need more Democrats in the government, or anyone who actually believes that a representative government is a public good.SETH BODNER, SUMMIT N.J.To the Editor:All of David Leonhardts suggestions seem common-sense, but Id add a needed first step: two years of mandatory national service for all citizens ages 18 to 28.Service doesnt have to be in the military, but everyone should have a common boot camp experience where valuable learning and training in basic civics, physical health and nutrition could take place.Big ideas without a firm foundation are, indeed, destined to fizzle.ELIZABETH BJORKMAN LEXINGTON, MASS.To the Editor:As the column states, different eras do require different solutions. If were going to move past our current economic stagnation, we need to understand how this century will differ from the last, economically, culturally and politically. Then we need leadership prepared to offer a rational vision for America in 2050 and beyond. We cannot go back, despite the hopes of many, so wed better find a way forward.There are many examples of how the worlds economic winners will achieve success for their people  things like universal health care; quality free education; detailed urban planning incorporating fast local and intercity public transportation and quality housing, solar and wind power  examples that are rejected by our reactionary ideologues.We are facing a stark choice: Invest strategically in a new, modernized America or become increasingly uncompetitive in the world.DEAN FOX, WALNUT CREEK, CALIF.
