Bedford Cheese Shop does not stand still. The Williamsburg flagship has moved and been enlarged more than once (a Manhattan branch on Irving Place opened in 2014). Now theyre at it again, driven by the opening of Whole Foods nearby, said Jason Scherr, an owner. They have added an appetizing section, the New York term for Jewish Eastern European specialties like smoked and cured fish, which are sold by the pound or on bagel sandwiches. Theyve also enhanced their line of prepared foods, started selling beer and wine on tap, and installed an espresso bar at a central island surrounded by increased seating. We cant compete with Whole Foods on groceries so were doing more with prepared foods and personal interaction, Mr. Scherr said: Bedford Cheese Shop, 265 Bedford Avenue (Grand Street), Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 718-599-7588, bedfordcheeseshop.com.Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.
