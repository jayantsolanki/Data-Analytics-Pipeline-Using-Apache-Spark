LONDON  An abundance of stainless steel in China following the ramp up of new production in Indonesia is threatening stainless mills globally and the nickel producers that supply them.Marking a major structural shift, China, which makes and consumes around half of the world\'s stainless, became a marginal net importer of hot-rolled stainless coil in December for the first time in more than seven years, data from the International Steel Statistics Bureau and from consultants CRU showed.This is after Chinese-owned stainless giant Tsingshan started production last August at a giant plant in Indonesia that should, by the end of 2018, have an annual capacity of 3 million tonnes.This is equivalent to 6 percent of last year\'s global flat stainless capacity, CRU says, and there is more to come, with China\'s Delong Holdings set to start production at its Indonesian stainless plant in 2019.

China\'s stainless prices have flatlined since mid-January at around 15,500 yuan a tonne.Stainless producers beyond China are also concerned.Finland\'s Outokumpu reported first quarter profits more than halving on falling prices and expects more of the same this quarter. Spain\'s Acerinox reported a drop of 40 percent in first quarter earnings, buffeted somewhat by solid U.S. earnings.In December, Handelsbanken downgraded Outokumpu citing the "tremendously negative" impact from low-cost capacity in Indonesia while Jefferies says weak Asian stainless markets are weighing on Acerinox in Europe and Africa.

Benchmark London Metal Exchange nickel (LME) prices <CMNI3> rose 27 percent last year amid a ramp up in global stainless output and they are up some 10 percent this year at around $14,000 (10,290 pounds). However, should stainless price weakness persist, mills, particularly those that are loss-making, could cut production. ING said, even before operating costs are accounted for, Chinese mills are in the red as stainless prices since December have fallen below nickel prices <CMCU3>.
